# SemicircleLaw
## Formalization of Wigner's Semicircle Law in Lean

Our goal is to formalize Wigner's Semicircle Law in [Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html). The result we will formalize is Theorem 2.3 in Todd Kemp's [Random Matrix Theory notes](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~tkemp/247A.Notes.pdf). The proof will be via the moment method.

Our project relies on the [Lean blueprint](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint/) tool by Patrick Massot.

The project [webpage](https://fredraj3.github.io/SemicircleLaw/) contains the [blueprint](https://fredraj3.github.io/SemicircleLaw/blueprint/) and dependency graph.

This project is a [Stanford Undergraduate Research Institute in Mathematics (SURIM)]

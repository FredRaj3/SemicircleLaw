\chapter{Empirical Distributions}

In this section, we let $\mathcal{X}$ be a Polish space. The topology on $\mathcal{X}$ will be generated by a metric $d$,
and we equip $\mathcal{X}$ with its Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{X})$. Further $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$
will be a general measurable space (we do not fix a measure on this space), and $n$ will denote an arbitrary natural number.
We will also sometimes refer to a second Polish space $\mathcal{Y}$ with associated metric $\tilde d$, also equipped with
its Borel $\sigma$-algebra. The space of measures on $\mathcal{X}$ will be denoted $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X})$, and the
space of probability measures on $\mathcal{X}$ will be denoted $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X})$. We endow $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X})$
with the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the projection maps $\{\pi_{A} : \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X}) \to \bR\}_{A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{X})}$,
and similarly for $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X})$.

We will also consider the space of multisets of elements in $\mathcal{X}$. This will be given the disjoint union topology, where
the union is over the $n$th symmetric power $\mathrm{Sym}^n \mathcal{X}$ for $n \in \bN$. The $n$th symmetric power has the quotient
topology inherited from $\mathcal{X}^n$

  Let $S$ be a multiset of elements in $\mathcal{X}$ with finite cardinality. Then the associated empirical distribution is the probability measure on $\mathcal{X}$ defined by
  \[
  {\sf ED}(S) = \frac{1}{|S|}\sum_{x \in S} \delta_{x}.
  \]
